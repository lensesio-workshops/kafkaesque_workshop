Now that you're all logged in, take a few moments to explore the Lenses 6 UI. Lenses 6 is built around working with multiple Kafka clusters, and when you first log in to the UI you are at the HQ level of Lenses. At this level you can work with multiple Kafka clusters at the same time. At this level you can search for clusters by name or search across topics and schemas by key words. You can also use the Global SQL Studio at this level. You can access these views via the icons down the side of the UI.
